        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hello,
            This is a personnal project I made to answer a question that kept me awake at night : can we predict NBA players' success by looking at their Rookie year stats ?
            This repository contains all the data, scripts and visualizations I made in order to come to a final result, aalong with this file that will detail my thought process, the choices I made and present the conclusions I arrived at.
        </p>
        <p>
        First of all, I wanted to define a characteristic, a feature, a label to put on to NBA players, to asses whether or not their careers were successful.
        This is not an easy question, as pro players careers are unique and success can't be measured so easily.
        I didn't want to spend too much time finding the perfect measure, since it probably doesn't exist, so I went with the easy one : career length. 
        The average NBA player career lasts 4.5 years. So our label, for successful player, will be 5Y, aka True if the player played >5 years in the league, and False if not.

        Now we can go into details about what has an impact on this label we put to all players, limiting ourselves to the Rookie statline and characteristics of the player in that exact time frame.

        <h2>NBA Rookies age per year</h2>
        <p>
            Since we focus on rookie years, I felt I had to take age into account. 
            Indeed, I know from my little understanding of the NBA world, that age is a big factor when it comes to selecting and then making a rookie play. 
            It also acts as a hidden variable in our chosen label. Of course a younger player has more time in front of him to play 5 years more and a better chance of earning the label than an older rookie.
            At the same time, rookies are selected based on their potential but also on their immediate qualities and output. So if player A is drafted younger than player B, it most likely means that teams value A's actual skillset higher than B's, else they would've chosen B earlier.

            Recruitement and scouting processes have become second to none in such industries where talent is worth billions. So we can, for the most part, trust franchises to make better choices now than 50 years ago.
            The internationnalisation of the NBA also brought forward new regions of the world to chose from, and ultimately increased the talent pool to pick from.
            
            //This also poses questions regarding the propoensity of the industry to focus too much on potential and age sometimes disregarding what players can do right now.
             
            Below is a graph showing the average rookie age each year from 1946 to 2019.
            The beige line *contains* the players that didn't make it >5Y, and the green line the 5Y players.

        <p>
            What jumps out first and foremost is that the green line is almost always below the beige one, especially in recent times.
            This fuels our previous theory, that scouting and recruitement processes are better than ever, and talent is detected young.

            Second important takeway : both lines steadily decline !
            Again, this means that players are drafted younger and younger. More than 1 full year younger on average for both groups of players in 15 years, this is massive !

        </p>
        <p>Funny little caveat : notice the little spike in 1976 ? This is the cause of the merge between the NBA and the ABA. Because ABA players hadn't played in the NBA, their first year was considered their rookie year ! This new influx of (older) players from the merger is mixed with the draftees, making for a spike in the average rookie age that year</p>
        <p>

            Aside from the rookie's age, there is another variable that is important to take into consideration when analysing it's arrival in the NBA : the drafting franchise.

        <h2>Drafting teams and their impact on players' longevity</h2>
        <p>
            If you were to be selected in the 2025 NBA draft, which team would you hope drafts you, and why ?
            Maybe you have a favorite team, and the thought of wearing their jersey fills you with joy ?
            Or maybe you'd want to be selected by the best team, hoping to be a part of a championship run ?

            That's all fun to discuss for you and I, because we will never be in such position, but the debat is very much happenning right now in every NBA prospect's mind, because their career and ultimately their life is on the line.
            What is the correct answer ? Is there an answer at all ? Is there a way to find the best team to get drafted into ?

            I'll try and provide one :

        <p>    
            What do we see here ? 
            We see all 30 teams ranked on 2 axes. The farther to the right a team is, the best it is at identifying talent (% of rookies that made it 5Y).
            And the higher it is, the more loyal the players it selects (% of years said rookies played in this franchise).
            
            So the best drafting team is Philadelphia, and the team that drafted the most loyal players is Boston. The interesting we infer from the global trend is that the farther to the right a team is, the lower it goes in the Y-Axis !
            Meaning that the better the players a team drafts, the less likely it is for the team to keep them around a long time.
            
            Finally, going back to our main question, we can continue stress free. Indeed, the difference in percentages of success rate between the best and worst drafting teams is too small to make an impact.
            That, plus the relative small sample sizes and the multiple unchecked variables (mainly the position in the draft leading to such draft picks) makes it impossible for us to conclude anything. Which is a good thing as it allows us to concentrate our efforts on the rookies' statline.

            Soooo, here is the main course. 
            Now that we dismissed every other variables, we can focus on the nitty gritty : rookies stats.

            What we'll try to do is train a model on all rookies numbers from 1946 to 2019, so it can deduce what successful players did or didn't do in their rookie year, and generalize it to our 2020+ draft classes, to predict whether or not they will make it >5Y.
            Here we go.

    <p>Est-ce que je met la matrice de correlation ? Ca va être trop complexe pour le grand public et pas assez intéressant pour un recruteur mais ça fait de la couleur. Je pense pas qu'il y en ait besoin.

        Explications des mesures et stats utilisées (la base, la ligne de stat classique en brut par match, on reste sur le plus simple)
        2-3 exemples sur les impacts des stats sur la longévité ? Vu que je met pas la matrice, peut-être pas. Juste une ligne de stat d'un mec en exmple avec une fonction en hover qui explique chaque stat (chaque acronyme) pour celleux qui connaissent pas.
