        <h1>Is it possible to predict future success of NBA players from their rookie seasons ?</h1>
    </header>
    <section id="intro">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            NBA franchises spend millions on players contracts, and sometimes it all comes crashing down and the player doesn't deliver on those hopes.
            A lot of things can go wrong in a career, but what if we could accurately predict the probability of a player to make it in the league by looking at his rookie number ?
            
            That's what we will try to do.
            We'll look at every NBA player's rookie satline ever, and build an AI model able to decipher what's important to predict future career success.
            Every dataset and python scripts will be included at the end.
        </p>
        <p>
        First of all, we need to define a characteristic, a feature, a label to put on to NBA players, to asses whether or not their careers were successful.
        This is not an easy question, as pro players careers are unique and success can't be measured so easily. But there is one thing we know, NBA teams have too much to lose paying and playing bad players.
        This is it then, our measure of success will be career length. The average for an NBA player is 4.5 years, and the median is at 3.
        </p>
        <b>
            Our label, for successful player will be 5Y, a boolean equal to True if the player played 5 years or more in the league, and False if not.
        </b>
        <p>
        Now that we have our target measure, we can start aksing questions and providing answers. But we still need to tackle a few things related to our measure choice.

        <h2>NBA Rookies age per year</h2>
        <p>
            Since we focus on rookie years, and our measure of success is the time spent in the league, we have to be careful with confounding variables such as the age at which the player begins it's carrer. 
            Indeed, I know from my little understanding of the NBA world, that age is a big factor when it comes to selecting and then making a rookie play, but it also affects the time a player can stay in the league (before losing athletical abilities). 
            Of course a younger player has more time in front of him to play 5 years more and a better chance of earning the label than an older rookie.
            Yet, rookies are selected based on their potential but also on their immediate qualities and output. So if player A is drafted younger than player B, it most likely means that teams value A's actual skillset higher than B's, else they would've chosen B earlier.

            Recruitement and scouting processes have become second to none in such industries where talent is worth billions. So we can, for the most part, trust franchises to make better choices now than 50 years ago.
            The globalization of the NBA also brought forward new regions of the world to chose from, and ultimately increased the talent pool to tap into.
                         
            Below is a graph showing the average rookie age each year from 1946 to 2019.
            The beige line shows the average age of rookies that didn't make it >5Y, and the green line the 5Y players.

        <p>
            What jumps out first and foremost is that the green line is almost always below the beige one, and more and more in recent times.
            This fuels our previous theory, that scouting and recruitement processes are better than ever, and talent is detected young.

            Second important takeway : both lines steadily decline !
            Again, this means that players are drafted younger and younger. More than 1 full year younger on average for both groups of players in the last 15 years, this is massive !

        </p>
        <i>
            Funny little caveat : notice the little spike in 1976 ? This is the cause of the merge between the NBA and the ABA. Because ABA players hadn't played in the NBA, their first year was considered their rookie year ! This new influx of (older) players from the merger is mixed with the draftees, making for a spike in the average rookie age that year</p>
        </i>

            Aside from the rookie's age, there is another important variable to take into consideration when analysing it's arrival in the NBA : the drafting franchise.

        <h2>Drafting teams and their impact on players' longevity</h2>
        <p>
            If you were to be selected in the 2025 NBA draft, which team would you hope drafts you ? Why ?
            Maybe you have a favorite team, and the thought of wearing their jersey fills you with joy ?
            Or maybe you'd want to be selected by the best team, hoping to be a part of a championship run ?

            That's all fun to discuss for you and I, because we will never be in such position, but the debate is very much happenning right now in every NBA prospect's mind, because their career and ultimately their life is on the line.
            What is the correct answer ? Is there an answer at all ? Is there a way to find the best team to get drafted by ?

            We'll try and provide one :
            
        </p>
        <div id='viz1733072331453' ><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Dashboard 1 ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Ro&#47;Rookiesageandloyalty&#47;Dashboard1&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='Rookiesageandloyalty&#47;Dashboard1' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Ro&#47;Rookiesageandloyalty&#47;Dashboard1&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='fr-FR' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div>                <script type='text/javascript'>                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1733072331453');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 800 ) { vizElement.style.width='1400px';vizElement.style.height='827px';} else if ( divElement.offsetWidth > 500 ) { vizElement.style.width='1400px';vizElement.style.height='827px';} else { vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height='777px';}                     var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                </script>        
        <p>    
            What do we see here ? 
            We see all 30 teams ranked on 2 axes. The farther to the right a team is, the best it is at identifying talent (% of rookies that made it 5Y).
            And the higher it is, the more loyal the players it selects (% of years said rookies played in this franchise).
            
            So the best drafting team is Philadelphia, and the team that drafted the most loyal players is Boston. The great idea we infer from the global trend is that the farther to the right a team is, the lower it goes in the Y-Axis !
            Suggesting that the better players a team drafts, the less likely it is for it to keep them around a long time.
            
            Finally, going back to our main question, we can continue stress free. Indeed, the difference in percentages of success rate between the best and worst drafting teams is too small to make an impact.
            That, plus the relative small sample sizes and the multiple unchecked variables (mainly the position in the draft leading to such draft picks) makes it impossible for us to conclude anything. Which is a good thing as it allows us to concentrate our efforts on the rookies' statline.

    <section id="Model">
        <p>
            Soooo, here is the main course. 
            Now that we dismissed every other variables we could think of, we can focus on the nitty gritty : rookies stats.

            What we'll do is train a model on all rookies numbers from 1946 to 2019, so it can deduce what successful players did or didn't do in their rookie year, and generalize it to our 2020+ draft classes, to predict whether or not they will make it >5Y.
            Here we go.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            We use rookies' per game base stats from nba_api. This, for example, is LeBron James' rookie statline.
        <img src="LeBron James.PNG" width="350px" height=auto>
            
        </p>
        <p>
            The trained model will be available on the repository as well as all the data and scripts used for this work but for now we want to appreciate what we got and play with it !
            We have a model that can predict the longevity of rookies with 75% accuracy, which is not bad considering how difficult talent evaluation is.
            We want to test it on new data, we want to know whether or not the 2023 draft class is as great as it was advertised ! 
            Does our model predict Wemby to make it 5Y ? Who is the one player that, despite beeing selected deep in the 1st round, has a chance of making it ? Who's the lottery bust ?
